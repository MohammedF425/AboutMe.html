                <h3>Mohammed Fadel's Bio</h3>
                <p>I was born in Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, NY, on July 08, 2003. I have been raised in Brooklyn my whole life and still live in the neighborhood I was brought up in. I have visited my home country, Yemen, multiple times over summer breaks. I am a sophomore at Brooklyn College studying in the major of computer science. When I was first exposed to technology, I became curious about its functions and how it works. This is what made me want to major in the field of computer science still volunteer around the neighborhood to help younger students in subjects that I am very good at, such as math. In my free time, I go to the park and play basketball with my friends and somethings go out to eat. When I am unable to go out on my leisure time, I would watch tv shows such as "The 100," and "Into the Badlands." </p>
